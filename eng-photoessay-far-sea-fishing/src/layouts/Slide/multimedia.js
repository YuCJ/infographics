All fishermen through offshore employment have to board the fishing boats immediately after completing health checkup.",

However, they still try to get a job on Taiwanese fishing boats one after another even though they may have no chance to go home. To pursue the dream of turning their lives around, many Indonesian fishermen go to sea under 20 years old at the cost of two-year freedom and uncertain destiny.",
