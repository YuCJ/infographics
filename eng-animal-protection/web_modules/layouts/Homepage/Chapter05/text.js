The policy on stray animals relates to everyone. Citizen input and consensus of opinion are keys to effective public policy implementation. After you read this report, please feel welcome to leave a comment and vote on othersâ€™ comments. Animal advocacy groups will be invited to make comments as well.
`

export const sec1Des = `Pol.is is a new digital tool for finding and visualizing consensus. In a pol.is conversation, participants write comments in response to an open-ended question and react to each other's comments by voting.  Through the use of statistical analysis, pol.is generates real-time visualization showing opinion groups that have formed. After logging in with a social network, people can see how they are grouped with friends and followers they tend to agree with. They can also find the representative comments that separate their group from other groups. By exploring, people gain insights into differences and similarities, thereby expediting the process of reaching consensus.`
