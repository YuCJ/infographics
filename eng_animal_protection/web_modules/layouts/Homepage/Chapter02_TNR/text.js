Stray animals will not disappear after the new zero-euthanasia policy. Most likely they will continue to roam the streets.
Then comes TNVR, a method promoted by animal welfare advocates to control the stray population.
In TNVR, except for aggressive or dangerous animals that must be caught and securely confined without posing a danger to the public,
strays are trapped, spayed, vaccinated and then returned to their outdoor “home” where people learn to co-exist with them. But TNVR is not entirely innocuous.

export const sec2Des = `Cities are not safe for homeless animals from an animal welfare perspective.
Many animals die from poisons or are hit by cars. The absence of intervention of any owner puts the lives of homeless animals at risk and potentially causing accidents or conflicts.`

export const sec3Des = `Although spaying and neutering helps control the stray population, swarms of dogs and cats continue to roam the streets. Excessive noise, feces or smell,
and aggression toward another animal, or even a person, may present safety and health hazards.

Now with shelters transitioning to zero-euthanasia, shelters could be forced to turn away animals due to a lack of capacity. Then comes the issue of living and interacting with a growing stray population.`

export const sec4Des = `Research has suggested that inadequate levels of sterilization are likely to increase the size of stray animal population as the unsterilized animals continue to breed. Even with an active TNVR program,
 overall population may continue to grow if there is no good control on the number of abandoned or homeless animals. Predictably, to contain stray population is becoming an uphill battle.

***The Reporter*** has created a 30-second game based on a trap-neuter-return (TNR) model developed by Lai Yi-te, who holds a Ph.D in biology from the University of Eastern Finland. With every click representing a sterilization treatment, the game gives an idea of whether TNR is able to catch up to the rates of breeding and abandonment by humans.`

    title: 'Simulation Model Proposed by Lai Yi-te',
    des: `Lai Yi-te, who holds a Ph.D in biology from the University of Eastern Finland, has developed a computer simulation model to evaluate the effectiveness of TNR strategies applying various assumptions about population dynamics and TNR intensity and consistency. Lai’s model is based on an international research paper on population changes of feral colonies.


The research paper cited by Lai calculates the sterilization rates required to eliminate the population of stray animals eventually. Provided spaying and neutering is done on 50% of the initial population with treatment divided evenly between males and females. Out of a colony of 6,000, 3,000 would need to be sterilized per year, and it takes 15 years to eliminate the colony population when the colony is isolated. If abandoned and untreated, free-roaming animals enter the population (though their numbers are few, just 5% of the initial population), spaying and neutering may reduce but never eliminate the colony population.


Assume there are 500 stray dogs living in an urban area (every dog icon represents 50 stray dogs). The population increases over time as dogs breed and new dogs come in (the number of population is updated every three seconds, which are equal to a year in the real world). The goal is to control population before the size reaches its limit of 5,000, or 100 dog icons.


The game starts off with a female dog giving birth to six cubs per year, the inclusion of two abandoned or free-roaming dogs into the population per year, and a certain number of aged dogs dying of natural causes. It turns out that the game requires 16 clicks in every three seconds in order to keep the dog population within the carrying capacity of its environment.


The game clearly shows the difficulties in managing population growth as TNR hardly catches up to animals’ breeding rates and owners dumping their pets. Lai notes that **continued abandonment and free-roaming animals, owned or unowned, are equally problematic**.`,
