Is no-kill policy the answer to ending the cycle of pet homelessness?

Pressure is now at tipping point for veterinarians and animal welfare inspectors working at resource-strapped public shelters.

No-kill policy paints a rosy picture that all animals can be saved and kept alive. But Taiwan may be in need of a reality check.

`Once there was a dog named Blue.

The name was given by her owner.

Blue wasn’t as blue as her name suggested before she was given up.`,


`The sun went, and darkness unfolded the street in a cool blanket.

Quite suddenly a promise made by Blue’s owner came up in her mind.

“I’ll take care of you, forever and always.”
`,


`Blue’s owner not only had given her a name, but also a home.

Pointing at the door behind him, he said:

“This is your home.”
`,


`Blue once had a happy time.`,

`But it didn’t last long.`,


`“I’m sorry. I cannot take care of you anymore.”

“But it’s alright. There is no shelter killing now.

You will be in good hands there at the shelter.”
`,


`Unwanted and forgotten, Blue spent her days living in a cage.

She thought: “Am I going to live the rest of my life here?”

`,


`
The day for a new owner and a new home never came.

`
Blue was one of the many animals

stacked in cages at shelters.

  `They share the same fate as Blue.`,

  `As Taiwan moves toward becoming a no-kill nation, many animals like Blue will remain in shelters for their lifetime. What is to become of them? `,

`Meanwhile, 120,000 or more displaced dogs continue to wander the streets. As most public shelters are filled to capacity, where do all the stray dogs go?`,

`Their fate hinges on how the public view the stray animal issue.
Are people ready to deal with it if strays are allowed to continue roaming freely?
Is the government ready to address potential consequences if all stray animals are taken into shelters and kept there for their entire lives?
