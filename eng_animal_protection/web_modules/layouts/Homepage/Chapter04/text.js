An increasing number of animals living in the streets are former pets that have either been abandoned or turned loose by irresponsible owners who let them continue reproducing and adding to the stray population. Of what value is all that animal welfare legislation if the government fails to raise awareness about responsible ownership and the dumping of pets cannot be stopped?

export const sec1Des = `Despite an overall improvement in awareness and attitude of pet owners, the urban-rural divide in concern about animal welfare is significant. In addition, there is a deep difference in the views of the young and the old on care and treatment provided to pet animals. Next are first-hand observations made by animal welfare inspectors interviewed by ***The Reporter***:`

export const sec2Des = `Many owners choose to dump their pets when they cannot or will not take responsibility for their animals. The cost of owning a pet from food and veterinary care to toys and treats could be overwhelming, especially veterinary bills that increase as pets get older. A single surgery can cost well above NT$10,000. The lifetime cost of veterinary care for a 10-kilogram 15-year-old female dog is estimated to be around NT$210,000.`

export const sec2End = `It is important to move beyond the same old story about educating pet owners. Without knowing and addressing the root cause, people too often fix only the surface-level problems. The biggest problem facing Taiwan’s animal welfare authorities is with the collection of data on pet population due to poor enforcement of pet licensing laws and microchip registry.

  `“Most of the loose dogs in the countryside are half-feral, half-domesticated. Many farmers pick up stray puppies, raise them as their own and allow their dogs to roam outdoors freely. There is very little bonding, and the owners are not very concerned about their dogs.”`,
  `“A lot of dogs in the countryside are not taken care of properly. They are fed on leftovers. Their water bowls get dirty with green algae. If a dog is raised in a poultry farm, it is often fed bad eggs and dead chicken. If it is raised in a cattle farm, it is fed placentas. A dog living in a pig farm is fed dead pig carcasses. It is very hard to change the older people’s habit of giving their dogs whole carcasses.”`,
  `“The old folks are probably the most difficult people to communicate with – even more so when it comes to animal welfare.  They feel it’s wrong to rid an animal of its reproductive right. Those who send their dogs and cats in for spaying/neutering are mostly young folks. Old people would not do so unless they are at risk of being penalized after repeated complaints from others.”`,
  `“A lot of information about animal welfare is on the internet. Many of the older people don’t know how to get online, so they are not aware of the animal shelters that could help. Government cleaners have to make the rounds of roadside gutters and bamboo groves every day to search and clean decomposing carcasses – double-bagged cats hung from bamboo trees and dead dogs left rotting in the gutter, as the folk tradition goes. You must change things around, one step at a time, but the question is: how?”`,
