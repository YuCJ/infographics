Solving the stray animal problem is going to take a multi-faceted approach. Whichever approach is chosen, implementation is key to success. To address stray overpopulation at the source, registration of pet animals, education of pet owners and regulation of breeders must be put in place. After 10 revisions made to the Animal Protection Act, has animal welfare legislation been upheld and enforced, or has it become a lost cause due to implementation issues? What are the problems that exist within and outside of the animal welfare authorities?

export const sec1Des = `Enacted in 1998, the **Animal Protection Act** has been amended 10 times to date. Has the problem of stray animals been addressed by the revisions? ***The Reporter***’s interviews with law enforcement personnel pointed to a number of factors, including a shortage of staff, that contribute to poor enforcement of animal welfare laws.`

export const sec2Des = `There are three types of personnel involved in animal welfare: staff and leadership of public shelters, veterinarians, and animal welfare inspectors. Among them, animal welfare inspectors are tasked with the most difficult responsibilities. In addition to handling animal welfare complaints, they use their veterinary knowledge along with legal and investigation skills to identity breaches of animal welfare standards and requirements, investigate illegal breeding kennels and issue citations.

Working in what their fellow co-workers call a “shitty” position, animal welfare inspectors are exposed first-hand to situations that give rise to feelings of anxiety, personal conflicts, and psychological stress. As the duties as inspector are largely assumed by junior veterinarians, high turnover among inspection staff lead to a persistent gap in knowledge and skills.

Struggling with work overload and short-staffing, animal welfare inspectors are unable to keep pace with increasing demand. As a result, the law is there but it is not enforced.

Take Taoyuan City. There is only one inspector who audits more than 200 pet shops and kennels in the city. The latest data available from the Council of Agriculture showed a total of 61,568 complaints and audits received and carried out throughout Taiwan in 2016, but the number of full- and part-time animal welfare inspectors was 154, meaning that each inspector must handle close to 400 animal care cases.`

export const barChartDes = `Municipal and county governments are hiring more and more part-time workers so that costs of labor can be saved. There are cases where part-time employees outnumber full-time employees.`

export const sec3Des = `The Animal Welfare Section, responsible for upholding and enforcing animal welfare legislation, faces enormous problems of short staffing and insufficient power vested in it.

The Council of Agriculture consists of six departments: the Department of Planning, the Department of Animal Industry, the Department of Farmers’ Services, the Department of International Affairs, the Department of Science and Technology and the Department of Irrigation and Engineering. The departments are further broken down into 24 sections.

The Animal Welfare Section, one of the units under the Department of Animal Industry, was previously known as the Livestock Administration Section. Its functions span from animal welfare protection to the regulation of animal husbandry industry. Understaffed and poorly coordinated with other agencies due to its low rank in the bureaucratic system, the Animal Welfare Section cannot meet the growing demand for more aggressive enforcement actions. `

      lawDes: 'The rules on pet owners’ responsibilities could be interpreted in different ways. Many owners, when facing a complaint about animal abuse or neglect, argue that allegations of them violating the provision on “providing a living environment that is safe, clean, well- ventilated, non-flooding with proper and adequate shelter, lighting and warmth” (Article 5) are due to different perceptions of animal welfare standards. In such cases, inspectors cannot but advise owners and give notice of potential penalties if noncompliance is found in the future.',

      lawDes: 'Previously, penalties were imposed on a pet owner for any failure to comply with mandatory registration of birth, acquisition, transfer, missing or death of his/her pet. After amendments to the Animal Protection Act, the owner cannot be penalized only in the event of his/her “refusal to take corrective actions after receiving advice about noncompliance” (Article 31). This has led to increased workload for inspectors to advise and ensure compliance, with pet owners thinking that they will take a chance as long as they can.',

The local competent authority shall issue an ID tag to each registered pet. Every pet shall get an ID microchip implant” (Article 19). But there is a widespread lack of awareness about microchipping. Animal registration is undertaken only once and need not be renewed, making it impossible for authorities to regularly assess animals (e.g. well-being). Moreover, enforcement is ineffective due to insufficient staffing.',
