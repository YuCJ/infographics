The new zero-euthanasia policy will inevitably lead to homeless animals being held in shelters for long periods of time. Yet, there has been a history of allegations of substandard animal care against public shelters. Will the government, with its well-intended ban on killing strays, step up to the plate and deliver on its promise to increase access to adoptable animals and improve facilities?

export const sec1Des = `Before the passage of the Animal Protection Act, strays were caught and handled by government cleaners based on the Waste Disposal Act. The animals were kept in temporary kennels in the periphery of landfill sites far from the public eye, much like how garbage was disposed, or taken in by public shelters.

Crammed into welded wire kennels and unprotected from sun and rain, many of the strays would eventually die from thirst, hunger and poor living conditions. There were reports of animals cannibalizing on each other or starving to death. The Animal Protection Act adopted in 1998 introduced reforms, and in 2009, the government ordered 14 municipal and county governments to shut down 104 temporary kennels.

export const sec2Des = `Building and running shelters that fit with the natural environment and provide for the welfare and care of animals remains a critical challenge.  After a “zero-euthanasia” policy passed the legislature, the government made improvement of animal shelters one of its priorities.

A public works project proposed by the Council of Agriculture in 2013 set out a plan to build 11 new animal shelters and renovate 10 existing ones. Despite government funding provided to the project, few contractors were willing to take on the job because of the shelters’ poor accessibility and concerns over possible protests from residents who did not want shelters to be near their homes for fear of noise and smell.`

export const sec3Des = `A public animal shelter is normally staffed with only one veterinarian. The veterinarian not only cares for the health of animals, but also has to attend the daily operations of the shelter from cleaning environment to rehoming homeless animals. What is to become of the veterinarian – already hard-pressed to juggle various responsibilities – after the zero-euthanasia policy takes effect?`
